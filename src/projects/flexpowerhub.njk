    <p>Radlkarte Salzburg is a bike routing web application in the country of Salzburg ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹. The Radlkarte helps to
        find the safest and fastest bikepaths around the Salzkammmergut. It also offers handy information like
        self-repair-stations, tire vending machines and bike shops. As the weather has a big impact on cycling there
        is also a rain radar with up to two hours forecast.</p>
