<p>
    Radroutenplaner Hessen is a native App on Android and iOS which provides routing for commuters and tourists alike in
    the state of Hessen 🇩🇪. It provides a wide bandwidth of points of interests and curated tours 🏞️. Custom routes can
    be saved and shared.
    <br/>
    During development I contributed to <a href="https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps">@rnmapbox/maps</a>, the unofficial
    Mapbox binding for React Native. As part of the app I've also built an API leveraging <a
            href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native">MapLibre GL Native</a> on Node.js to create static map images.
