Radlkarte Salzburg is a web application for bicycle route planning in the Austrian state of Salzburg 🇦🇹. Developed in
collaboration with the municipality and state government, it offers authoritative guidance on the safest and most
efficient cycling routes 🚲.

The interactive map highlights useful amenities like repair stations, tube dispensers, and bike shops – everything you
need for daily cycling. A built-in rain radar 🌦️ helps riders plan ahead and stay dry on the go.
