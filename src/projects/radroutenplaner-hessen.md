Radroutenplaner Hessen is a native App on Android and iOS which provides routing for commuters and tourists alike in
the state of Hessen 🇩🇪. It provides a wide bandwidth of points of interests and curated tours 🏞️. Custom routes can
be saved and shared.

Through the development of the app I started
maintaining [@maplibre/maplibre-react-native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-react-native), the MapLibre Native
binding for React Native. As part of the app I've also built an API
leveraging [MapLibre Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native) on Node.js to create static map images.
