A custom app was developed for the 2018 and 2019 editions of the Cologne Marathon 🏃‍♀️🏃, delivering a complete
experience for both runners and spectators 📱.

The app offered live runner tracking, real-time leaderboard positions, social challenges, personalized results,
achievement badges, and more. On race day, it successfully scaled to support tens of thousands of active users—runners
and fans alike.
