Radroutenplaner Hessen is a native Android and iOS app that offers route planning for both commuters and tourists
across the German state of Hessen 🇩🇪. The app features a rich collection of points of interest and curated scenic tours
🏞️, with support for saving and sharing custom routes.

During the development of this app, I began
maintaining [@maplibre/maplibre-react-native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-react-native), the official React
Native binding for MapLibre Native. I also developed a companion API
using [MapLibre Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native) on Node.js to generate high-quality static map
images on demand.
