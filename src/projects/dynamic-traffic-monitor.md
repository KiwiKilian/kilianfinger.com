Dynamic Traffic Monitor is a SaaS platform for real-time monitoring and analysis of traffic data. Built on a scalable
big data architecture, it enables users to explore motorized individual traffic 🚗, public transport 🚏, and environmental
💨 data through a unified interface and shared analytical graphs.

I led the frontend development, implementing performance-focused techniques like virtualization and intelligent
preloading to ensure a responsive experience – even with thousands of data points on screen. I also architected the
Management Core, a key system component that handles tenant-level authorization, enabling secure and flexible data
sharing across organizations.
