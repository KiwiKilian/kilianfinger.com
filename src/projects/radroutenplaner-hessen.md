Radroutenplaner Hessen is a native App on Android and iOS which provides routing for commuters and tourists alike in
the state of Hessen 🇩🇪. It provides a wide bandwidth of points of interests and curated tours 🏞️. Custom routes can
be saved and shared.

During development I contributed to [@rnmapbox/maps](https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps), the unofficial Mapbox binding
for React Native. As part of the app I've also built an API
leveraging [MapLibre GL Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native) on Node.js to create static map images.
