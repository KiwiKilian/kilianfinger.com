  <p>
    I personally care about privacy a lot. Therefore I have made many technical efforts, to collect and store as little
    data as possible from you. The following privacy policy is more about clear and understandable words than legal
    bullshit. If you still have questions, just contact me!

    When you access my website, your IP address, operating system, browser including version, requested URL and the
    referrer URL are transmitted to my hosting provider. This also creates metadata such as a timestamp of the request,
    success or error message and the amount of data transferred. This data is only available during the processing your
    request of my website. A storage after the completion of each request is not happening, no logfiles are written. A
    visit to a website without processing of this data for at least a fraction of a second is simply not possible, as
    it's required by technical standards.

    the fulfillment of contractual obligations.
